     #### Wake-On-LAN setting on machines ####

[1]. First of all enables the Wake-On-LAN setting on the system at booting time 

-> Turn on the system and enter the wake on lan setting by pressing "ctrl +S" key combination

-> The "device List" option setting displays in the screen.      // This list contains the information of NIC(including mac address) of the system. select the appropriate option 

-> Click the appropriate option. Then "Main Menu" option setting displays in the screen. Which contains two options
    - MBA configuration
    - iSCSI Boot Configuration

-> Click the "MBA configuration" option.

-> Enable the "Pre-boot Wake On LAN" option setting. Then save it and log-in to system. 


[2]. Enable Wake-On-LAN setting in host 

-> Install ethtool by command
     "sudo apt-get install ethtool" 

-> To check whether Wake-On-LAN is enabled in the NIC, use command 
     "sudo ethtool <NIC>"   ( where <NIC> is the name of ethernet interface (eth0/ em1) )
        
-> There are few options under the name "Settings for <NIC>:", which specifies:
      
      Supports Wake-on:   // specifies which Wake-On-LAN modes the network interface supports 
      Wake-on:            // specifies which mode is currently enabled
      Link detected:      // specifies LAN connectivity to ethernet interface. ( yes: connected , no: not connected)
          
             Wake-On-LAN modes are characters which specifies:
                      p  Wake on phy activity
                      u  Wake on unicast messages
                      m  Wake on multicast messages
                      b  Wake on broadcast messages
                      a  Wake on ARP
                      g  Wake on MagicPacket(tm)
                      s  Enable SecureOn(tm) password for MagicPacket(tm)
                      d  Disable (wake on nothing).

-> The command used for enable wake on lan 
      "ethtool -s <NIC> wol g"  ( command is not enable Wake-On-LAN setting permanently but only for current session)


[3]. For permanently enable Wake-On-LAN setting

-> Change the directory
       "cd /etc/init.d/"

-> Open a text editor with file named wakeonlanconfig
       "pico wakeonlanconfig"

-> Now write down these lines into file and save
       " #!/bin/bash
         ethtool -s <NIC> wol g         
         exit  "                    ( where <NIC> is the name of ethernet interface (eth0/ em1) )

-> Set the permissions of the file:
      "chmod a+x wakeonlanconfig"

-> Make the script run on startup by the command
       "update-rc.d -f wakeonlanconfig defaults"

-> Run the script by this command
       "/etc/init.d/wakeonlanconfig"


[4]. Here we choose to wake-up(turn-on) system by using MagicPacket(tm). To allow these functionality 

-> Install wakeonlan by  
       "apt-get install wakeonlan"

-> Send the command to wake-up particular system by
       "wakeonlan <MAC-ADDRESS>"           (Where <MAC-ADDRESS> is the mac address of the particular system to which we want to send MagicPacket(tm) ) 

-> There are two ports specifies for Wake-On-LAN, port(7) and port(9). In which port(9) is by default. So if above command does not work try this 
       "wakeonlan -p 7 <MAC-ADDRESS>"    ( Where 7 is a port number)
               

// * In the new "PowerEdge R720" server the first step is not Mandatary as it enables Wake-On-LAN setting automatically.
