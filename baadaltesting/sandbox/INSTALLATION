1. make utils
   This will fetch all the required installers and the ubuntu ISO

2. make configure
   This will get the IP address range to be used for the internal network
   e.g., 10.0.0.0 or 192.168.0.0

3. make openvswitch
   This will install openvswitch on the sandbox machine. It requires access
   to a mirror hosting the PPA repo.	The instructions to create a mirror are
   at https://launchpad.net/~ivoks/+archive/ovs-saucy. The mirror is only
   20MB in size. Fill the webserver's address in Makefile's PROFILE_PPA
   variable.

4. make switch LIBVIRT_INSTALL=yes VIRTMANAGER_INSTALL=yes
   This will setup the internal bridges on the sandbox machine. These
   arguments reinstall libvirt and virtmanager -- this may be required
   if the machine has old versions of these programs.

5. make baadal-transfer-tar
   This will create a ~/.baadal/utils/baadal.tar file, which is to be
   transferred to all the VMs. If an old version of baadal.tar exists, and
   you want to replace it with a new one (because you think that something
   has changed), type 'make clean-transfer-tar' before this command.

6. make nat
   This will create the NAT VM. The NAT VM should be completely installed
   before installing the controller, because the controller's post VM
   installation script requires NAT to be setup.


7.. Go to the NAT VM and type
   $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
   $ make openvswitch
   $ make nat-setup

NOTE: Restart NAT machine after executing make nat-setup file and before proceeding to next step.



NOTE: For better performance you may use the sandbox machine as the filer. So you may skip STEP 8 and run STEP 9 on sandbox machine.

8. make filer 
   This will create the filer VM. Can be tested by mounting x.y.0.4:/baadal/data
   on the sandbox machine. (here x.y=10.0 or 192.168 depending on internal
   network IPs). The data on the filer is stored in /baadal/data.

9. Go to filer VM or sandbox machine(in case you have not created a filer vm using make filer command and want to use sandbox machine as the filer) and type
    $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
    $ make filer-setup

10. make controller

11. Go to controller VM and type
    $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
    $ make openvswitch
    $ make controller-setup
    On controller machine edit /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/controller_installation.cfg
    $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation
    $ ./controller_installtion.sh

---- start creating hosts ----

NOTE: Before you start creating host vms, configure MAC address of the host to be created on the http://<ip-of-controller-machine>. Under the admin menu first "Configure Private IP" for each host. Then under the admin menu goto "Configure Host" and using the MAC address configure the host. This will create an entry in the DHCP server and will enable the host to boot from PXE server running on the controller machine.
      
12. On the sandbox machine, type
    $ make host HOST_ID=id
    Currently, nine MAC addresses have been specified in the script with
    IDs 1-9.

13. Optionally, go to the host VM and type
    $ cd /baadal/baadal/baadaltesting/sandbox
    $ make host-setup
    Actually this should not be required as the host should have been
    preseeded using PXE boot from the controller.

14. Set passwordless ssh between each host from root user
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa -N "" // If public key not present for root user create using this command
    $ ssh-copy-id root@<ip-of-each-host>

15. Create VM templates, place them in /baadal/data/vm_templates. 

16. Create users(if not using ldap), Configure datastore, templates, security domain, private ip pool and public ip pool using the baadal web portal under the admin menu.
