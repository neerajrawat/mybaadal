  # NOTE TO DEVELOPER
  # Apparently trunking is not needed here. This is because an openvswitch
  # interface will act as trunk port for all vlans by default if there are
  # no trunk values as well as no tag values defined for the interface. It
  # should be better is these things are explicitly defined as this is not
  # well documented in openvswitch's docs. If any trunk value or tag value
  # is defined for an interface on openvswitch then it automatically won't
  # work as trunk for all other remaining vlans. In baadal's current state
  # eth0 will act as trunk for vlans 1-255 and will filter out traffic for
  # all other vlans.
